                    <p> Hello! I'm Kruthika, an aspiring codekrafter. An amateur in web development
                          but curious and eager to learn more.
                          Alongside, I also have a working knowledge of French, which has helped me 
                          expand my perspective and communication skills.
                          Looking forward to learn from seniors and grow through this club.

                        <p><b>SKILLS:</b> As a <b>content writer</b> in <i>The Literary club of SRMIST RMP</i> 
                            , I've had the chance to express ideas creatively,
                             draft event write ups, and contribute to newsletters. This role
                             has sharpened my writing and story telling skills. This experience has 
                             improved my ability to wrtie with clarity and impact, while also teaching 
                             me how to adapt style and tone for different audiences. Beyond just writing,
                             I've learned to collaborate with a team, brainstorm ideas, and ensure our 
                             content connects with readers. I've been <b> learning French </b> and can communicate
                             at an intermediate level. This has helped me develop language skills, 
                             improve my understanding of different cultures, and enhance my ability
                             to express my ideas clearly. Learning French has also taught me discipline,
                             consistency and the joy of exploring new ways to connect with people.
